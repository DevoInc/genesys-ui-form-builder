import { Meta, Canvas, Source } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';

import * as Stories from './FormBuilder.stories';

<Meta of={Stories} />

## Example

This is an example of the `FormBuilder` with some elements

<Canvas of={Stories.Example} />

## Without group

This is an example of the `FormBuilder` without group.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithoutGroup} />

## Custom field

We can also add our own fields to the `FormBuilder` using the prop `fields`, for
example, in the next code you will see a new field `custom` that only render the
`value` on it:

<Source dark={true} code={`
...
fields={{
  custom: ({
    value, // current value of the field
  }) => {
    return <div>{value}</div>
  }
}}
...
`} />

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomField} />

**Note:** The custom fields will override the predefined one, so if you use a
field with the key `number` will override the `number` predefined field.

## Actions

Actions are the way to insert custom behaviors on the form builder, you can add
an action and then call it from any field.

<Canvas of={Stories.Actions} />

The `actions` prop are an object with the name of the action as `key` and the
callback as the `value`.

For the callback the interface is an object with this properties:

- **prev:** The previous value
- **next:** The next value
- **props:** The props of the field
- **change:** The callback for update the value
  ```js
  (value: any) => void
  ```
- **reset:** The callback for return to the previous value
  ```js
  () => void
  ```
