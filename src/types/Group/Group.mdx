# Group

The group is a type that can contains other types using its prop `children`

## Example

`true`.

You can use props `name` for add info for the user

<Canvas of={Stories.Decorators} />

Another interesting prop is `truncateLine` to truncate the name of the
group in `n` lines, by default is `1`
