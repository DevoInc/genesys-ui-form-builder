# Visibility

We have two ways of achieve the visibility management:

- **Show/Hide:** with this method you can maintain the values of the
  branch and in the model the values still exists.
- **Create/Remove:** with this method the model will have the branch or
  nothing at all.

## Example of show/hide

In this example if you show the hidden text, change its value and hide again,
when you open it again the content will be intact.

<Canvas of={Stories.Example} />

## Example of create/remove

This another example shows the opposite behavior, if you repeat the steps
described above then the content of the hidden field will be empty each time you
open it again.

<Canvas of={Stories.Example2} />
