# Publish

In a clean environment do:

```sh
npm ci
npm run release
```

```sh
// You can specify the release type with
npm run release -- -r <major|minor|patch>

// Or even a prerelease with
npm run release -- -p
```

For test the next version but don't do anything use

```sh
npm run --ignore-scripts release -- --dry-run
```

For known all the posible options for release check

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/standard-version --help
```

Also maybe you want to know what is going to be on the published package for
this you can use

```sh
npm pack
```

This generate a tarball and list each file inside the package.
